name: "Changelog + PR Validation"

# ðŸ“Œ This workflow handles both:
# - Enforcing semantic PR titles (so changelogs are meaningful)
# - Automatically generating changelog updates using release-please
#
# ðŸ§  Purpose:
# We're using this to organize our commit history and changelog structure.
# The goal is to clean up the mess and ensure we have a clear record of changes.
#
# ðŸ‘€ Note for Andre:
# This will let you (and others) track whatâ€™s changing in dev/sbx/prod easily via the generated changelog.
